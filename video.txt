India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh met his Chinese counterpart, General Lee Shankfu.
India stuck to the same principles as before. Resolve the border first, then we can normalize.
What about the Chinese? They say, let's not focus just on the border.
Let's look at the border as part of the largest scheme of things.
In other words, put it on the back burner.
The question is, why are the Chinese so eager to normalize relations now?
Two things. Number one, China sees India as a big market.
Their exports to India were worth $118 billion.
The second reason is multilateral engagement.
China's ultimate goal is to reshape the global order.
So, without New Delhi's support, a new order is not possible, hence China's eagerness to normalize ties with India.
India must realize and leverage this.
It's not enough to just say that we are delinking the border and bilateral relations.
It must also reflect on the ground.
